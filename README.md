# Blue-Green Deployment of BankApp (Kubernetes)

This project demonstrates a **Blue-Green Deployment strategy** using Kubernetes, applied to a Spring Boot-based banking application â€“ `bankapp`.

Two identical environments (`blue` and `green`) are deployed with the ability to seamlessly switch traffic between them.

---

## What is Blue-Green Deployment?

**Blue-Green Deployment** is a release management strategy where:

- Two versions of your application (Blue and Green) run in parallel.
- Blue is the live version; Green is the new version.
- Once the Green environment is tested and verified, traffic is routed to it.
- If anything goes wrong, switching back to Blue is quick and simple.

            cpu: "1000m"
```

## How to Switch Traffic
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: bankapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: bankapp
    version: blue  # Change this to green to switch environments
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```
```
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```
  ##  Deploy both environments:
```
kubectl apply -f deployments/bankapp-blue.yaml
kubectl apply -f deployments/bankapp-green.yaml

```
```
kubectl apply -f service.yaml  # with version: blue
```
